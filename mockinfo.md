# Camp at Anawangin Cove
Anawangin Cove is one of the most popular camping spots in Zambales. The sheltered bay boasts an ash-colored beach due to the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption.

It's surrounded with a vast, evergreen, and tall Agoho trees similar to pine trees. Imagine if Boraca and Baguio had a baby, this would be it.

This is a go-to place for first-time and experience camper alike. Make sure that you bring everything you need going here, like food, cooking materials, toiletries and camp essentials.
